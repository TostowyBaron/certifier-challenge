# Certifier Frontend Challenge

## 🚀 About The Project

This is my implementation of the **Certifier Frontend Challenge**. The goal was to build a responsive, pixel-perfect landing page based on a provided Figma design.

The project was built using **Next.js 14** (with App Router), **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, with a strong focus on clean architecture, semantic HTML, and accessibility.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Pixel-Perfect Fidelity**: The page was implemented with great attention to detail to match the Figma design as closely as possible.
- **Fully Responsive**: The layout fluidly adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to wide desktop monitors.
- **Accessibility in Mind**: Built with semantic HTML and basic ARIA attributes to ensure the page is more accessible to users of assistive technologies.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Utilizes the latest standards and tools, including Next.js App Router and TypeScript.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: A logical and clean project structure based on reusable components.
- **Interactive UI**: Includes subtle transitions and hover states to enhance the user experience (UX).

## 📝 My Comments

- I paid special attention to creating a clean component structure that would make future development and maintenance easier.
- In the `Navbar` component, I implemented accessibility basics, such as keyboard navigation for the mobile menu and appropriate ARIA attributes, to provide a better experience for all users.

Thank you for the opportunity to take on this challenge! 😊
